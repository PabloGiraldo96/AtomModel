*Ernest Rutherford's atomic model, proposed in the early 20th century, is famous for introducing the concept of the atomic nucleus. Rutherford's model suggested that atoms consist of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with electrons orbiting around the nucleus at a distance.*

This model contains a nucleus and the orbits of an atom, I would like to make the electrons flying around the nucleus but I think it will come later.

Also I have leveled up putting the 3d Model into a eucledian space, showing it on it X, Y and Z axes. 

I hope you enjoy! This was a little project that I had in mind some while ago, so. 

Thank you!
