*Ernest Rutherford's atomic model, proposed in the early 20th century, is famous for introducing the concept of the atomic nucleus. Rutherford's model suggested that atoms consist of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with electrons orbiting around the nucleus at a distance.*

This model contains a nucleus and the orbits of an atom, I would like to make the electrons fly around the nucleus, but I think that will come later.

I have also leveled up the 3d model by putting it into a euclidean space, showing it on the X, Y and Z axes.

I hope you enjoy it! This was a little project I had in mind some time ago, so.

Thank you very much!
